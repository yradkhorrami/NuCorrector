# NuCorrector
Performs neutrino energy correcton coming from semi-leptonic decays inside a jet
the processor is an intermediate processor that gets number (and index) of semileptonic decays of heavy flavours and performs kinematic fit to calculate neutrino energy producing in semileptonic decays.
The result (neutrino energy in form of float(for event) and float vector(for individual neutrinos)) is given out as process parameter inside a collection to do further analysis (like pfoAnalysis) on semileptonic decays.
